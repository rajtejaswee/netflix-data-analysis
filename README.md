# Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization

Welcome to the **Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization** project! This project explores the rich dataset of Netflix content, uncovering trends, patterns, and insights through interactive and static visualizations.

We delve into various aspects like content type, country of production, popular actors, genres, and temporal trends in content uploads to answer questions like:
- What type of content dominates Netflix?
- Which countries are leading in production?
- How has the content evolved over the years?
